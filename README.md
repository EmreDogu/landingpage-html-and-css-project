# landingpage-html-and-css-project

My first real webdesign project for testing and practicing results of HTML Foundations, CSS Foundations and FlexBox courses. Tested and applied skills are:
  - All of the HTML Skills that I learned at [course repository](https://github.com/EmreDogu/full-stack-course/tree/main/1-HTML-Foundations/).
  - All of the CSS Skills that I learned at [course repository](https://github.com/EmreDogu/full-stack-course/tree/main/2-CSS-Foundations/).
  - Mainly FlexBox for design that I learned at [course repository](https://github.com/EmreDogu/full-stack-course/tree/main/3-FlexBox/).
  
Also website is built using [GitHub Pages](https://emredogu.github.io/landingpage-html-and-css-project/) for reviewing.
